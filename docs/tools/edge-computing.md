## Edge Computing Benefits

### Performance

- **Reduced latency** - Process data closer to users
- **Improved response times** - Faster application performance
- **Real-time processing** - Enable real-time analytics and decisions
- **Bandwidth optimization** - Reduce data transfer to cloud

### Reliability

- **Offline operation** - Continue working without cloud connectivity
- **Fault tolerance** - Distributed processing reduces single points of failure
- **Local redundancy** - Multiple edge nodes for high availability
- **Network resilience** - Less dependent on network connectivity

### Cost Efficiency

- **Reduced bandwidth costs** - Less data transfer to cloud
- **Optimized resource usage** - Process data where it's generated
- **Lower cloud costs** - Reduce cloud compute and storage needs
- **Efficient scaling** - Scale processing closer to demand
