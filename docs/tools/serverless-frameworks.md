## Serverless Benefits

### Cost Efficiency

- **Pay-per-use** - Only pay for actual execution time
- **No idle costs** - No charges when functions aren't running
- **Automatic scaling** - Scale to zero when not needed
- **Reduced operational overhead** - No server management costs

### Developer Productivity

- **Focus on code** - No infrastructure management
- **Faster deployment** - Quick iteration and deployment cycles
- **Built-in scaling** - Automatic handling of traffic spikes
- **Event-driven** - Natural fit for reactive architectures

### Operational Benefits

- **High availability** - Built-in redundancy and failover
- **Automatic updates** - Platform handles security patches
- **Monitoring included** - Built-in logging and metrics
- **Global distribution** - Deploy functions worldwide
