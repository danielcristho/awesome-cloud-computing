## Core Concepts

> The service models and deployment models below are based on the
> NIST definition of cloud computing (SP 800-145).

### Service Models

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** - Virtual machines, storage, and networking resources
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** - Managed platforms for application development and deployment
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** - Fully managed applications delivered over the internet

### Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud** - Cloud services delivered over the public internet
- **Private Cloud** - Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud** - Combination of public and private cloud environments
- **Multi-Cloud** - Use of services from multiple cloud providers
- **Community Cloud** - Cloud infrastructure shared by several organizations with common concerns\
