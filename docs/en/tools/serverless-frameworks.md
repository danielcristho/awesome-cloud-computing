## Serverless Characteristics

> Common characteristics of serverless computing as described in
> industry practice and cloud provider documentation.

### Cost Model

- **Pay-per-use** - Charges based on execution time or requests
- **No idle resources** - No cost when functions are not running
- **Automatic scaling** - Scale based on demand
- **Reduced infrastructure management** - No server provisioning

### Development Experience

- **Application-focused** - Infrastructure concerns are abstracted
- **Fast iteration** - Short deployment and feedback cycles
- **Event-driven** - Well-suited for reactive and asynchronous workloads

### Operational Considerations

- **Availability handled by platform** - Built-in redundancy
- **Managed runtime updates** - Platform-managed patches
- **Integrated observability** - Logs and metrics provided by the platform
- **Global execution** - Functions can run in multiple regions

## Framework Comparison

### Multi-Cloud Frameworks

- **Serverless Framework** - Supports multiple cloud providers
- **Pulumi** - Infrastructure as Code with serverless support
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure provisioning with serverless resources

### Provider-Specific Frameworks

- **AWS SAM** - Native serverless framework for AWS
- **Chalice** - AWS-focused Python framework
- **AWS CDK** - Infrastructure as Code with serverless constructs

### Language-Focused Tools

- **Zappa** - Python web applications on AWS Lambda
- **Functions Framework** - Multi-language serverless framework for Google Cloud
