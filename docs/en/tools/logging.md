> Logging refers to the collection, processing, and analysis of log data
> generated by cloud and cloud-native systems, enabling troubleshooting,
> auditing, and operational visibility in distributed environments.

| **ELK Stack** | Is an acronym that stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Together, these three components provide a powerful, integrated solution for managing large volumes of data, offering real-time insights and a comprehensive analytics suite. Centralized logging and analytics stack commonly used in cloud and distributed environments | [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) |
| **Fluentd** | Is a cross-platform open-source data collection software project originally developed at Treasure Data. Cloud-native log collector and forwarder designed for containers and dynamic infrastructures. | [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org) |

## Logging Fundamentals

### Log Levels

- **<span style="color:#6c757d;">DEBUG</span>** - Detailed information for diagnosing problems
- **<span style="color:#0d6efd;">INFO</span>** - General information about system operation
- **<span style="color:#f0ad4e;">WARN</span>** - Warning messages for potentially harmful situations
- **<span style="color:#dc3545;">ERROR</span>** - Error events that might still allow the application to continue
- **<span style="color:#7a1f1f;">FATAL</span>** - Very severe error events that might cause the application to abort

### Log Types

- **Application logs** - Logs generated by cloud-native applications and services
- **System logs** - Operating system and runtime-level events
- **Security logs** - Authentication, authorization, and security-related events
- **Audit logs** - Compliance and governance tracking
- **Access logs** - API gateway, load balancer, and service access records

## Logging Architecture

### Log Collection

- **Log agents** - Collect logs from various sources
- **Log forwarding** - Send logs to centralized systems
- **Log parsing** - Structure unstructured log data
- **Log enrichment** - Add context and metadata

### Log Processing

- **Filtering** - Remove irrelevant log entries
- **Transformation** - Convert log formats
- **Aggregation** - Combine related log entries
- **Correlation** - Link related events across systems

### Log Storage

- **Centralized storage** - Single location for all logs
- **Indexing** - Enable fast log searching
- **Retention policies** - Manage log lifecycle
- **Compression** - Optimize storage usage

### Log Analysis

- **Search and query** - Find specific log entries
- **Visualization** - Create charts and dashboards
- **Alerting** - Notify on specific log patterns
- **Reporting** - Generate regular log reports
