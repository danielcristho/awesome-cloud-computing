# Containerization

> Containerization is a technology that enables packaging applications
> and their dependencies into isolated containers, allowing consistent
> deployment across different environments.

## Container Engines

> Tools responsible for building, running, and managing containers at the runtime level.
> These engines handle image execution, isolation, and container lifecycle.

## Container Benefits

### Development

- **Consistency** - Same environment from development to production
- **Isolation** - Applications run independently
- **Portability** - Run across different platforms
- **Efficiency** - Lower overhead compared to virtual machines

### Operations

- **Scalability** - Supports horizontal scaling
- **Resource Utilization** - Improved hardware usage
- **Deployment Speed** - Fast startup and rollout
- **Rollback Capability** - Easier version rollback
