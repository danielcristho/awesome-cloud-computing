## Why Multi-cloud?

> Multi-cloud approaches are often adopted to address specific technical,
> operational, or regulatory requirements. The following points summarize
> commonly cited considerations.

### Potential Benefits

- **Vendor Independence** - Reduce reliance on a single cloud provider
- **Cost Considerations** - Compare pricing and service options across providers
- **Risk Distribution** - Avoid single-provider dependency for critical workloads
- **Service Selection** - Use specific services where they best fit requirements
- **Compliance Needs** - Address data residency or regulatory constraints

### Common Challenges

- **Operational Complexity** - Managing multiple platforms and APIs
- **Skill Requirements** - Maintaining expertise across providers
- **Security Consistency** - Applying uniform security policies
- **Cost Visibility** - Tracking and attributing spend across environments
- **Integration Effort** - Connecting services and workflows across clouds
